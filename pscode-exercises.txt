// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

Input a
Input b
Sum = a + b
Print Sum

// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

Input i
if i/2 = %
print even
else print odd 



// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

tell input - "enter 5 numbers"
input int [] numbers = (1n,2n,3n,4n,5n)
Set AVG to (1n+2n+3n+4n+5n)/5
print AVG

if(n1>n2)
set min to n2
else set min to n1
if(n3<min)
set min to n3
if (n4<min)
set min to n5
Print "the Min is"
Print min 

if(n1<n2)
set max to n2
else set max to n1
if(n3>max)
set max to n3
if (n4>max)
set max to n5
Print "the max is"
Print max 


a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
